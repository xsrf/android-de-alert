    Possible Types for additional_cbs_channels_strings "type=<type>":
    https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/android-8.1.0_r81:packages/apps/CellBroadcastReceiver/src/com/android/cellbroadcastreceiver/CellBroadcastChannelManager.java;l=27
    shows "earthquake","tsunami","other"
    https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/android-8.1.0_r81:packages/apps/CellBroadcastReceiver/res/values-mcc404/config.xml
    shows "area"
    https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/android-8.1.0_r81:packages/apps/CellBroadcastReceiver/src/com/android/cellbroadcastreceiver/CellBroadcastChannelManager.java;l=77
    suggests these are possible:
    https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/android-8.1.0_r81:packages/apps/CellBroadcastReceiver/src/com/android/cellbroadcastreceiver/CellBroadcastAlertService.java;drc=f2aa182a4bc98d7c5e7ea1b5ea3255de5c448423;l=144
    Type (not case sensitive):
        public enum AlertType {
            DEFAULT,
            ETWS_DEFAULT,
            ETWS_EARTHQUAKE,
            ETWS_TSUNAMI,
            TEST,
            AREA,
            INFO,
            OTHER
        }    
    However, "DEFAULT" throws an exception:
    E CellBroadcastChannelManager: Failed to parse "0x0DD-0x0DF:type=DEFAULT, emergency=true". e=java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No enum constant com.android.cellbroadcastreceiver.CellBroadcastAlertService.AlertType.DEFAULT
    and "tsunami" is obviously not the same as "ETWS_TSUNAMI".
    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
